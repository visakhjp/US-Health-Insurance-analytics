# US-Health-Insurance-analytics
This project provides a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of US Health Insurance data to identify key cost drivers, patient demographics, and risk factors. By leveraging Power BI, SQL, and Excel, the analysis transforms raw patient data into actionable business intelligence.

## Dashboard Architecture

1. **Patient Analysis (Demographics)** Focuses on the "Who." This dashboard provides a census-style view of the applicant pool, including regional distribution and gender/age splits.  
   **Key Insight:** Balanced gender distribution but significant regional clusters in the Southeast.

2. **Insurance Cost Analysis (Financials)** Focuses on the "What." This explores the financial variance across different profiles.  
   **Key Insight:** Smokers pay significantly higher premiums (Avg ~$32k) compared to non-smokers (Avg ~$8k).

3. **Risk Profile & Cost Drivers (Analytics)** Focuses on the "Why." This deep dive uses advanced visuals to identify the highest financial risks.  
   **Key Insight:** The combination of Obesity and Smoking leads to the highest insurance charges, regardless of region.
